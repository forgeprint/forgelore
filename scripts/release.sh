Read the above, then push the tag. That is the whole publish step: the
release workflow builds these same artifacts again on a clean runner and
drafts a release from them, for you to read and publish.

  git tag -s $version -m "$version"   # or -a if you do not sign tags
  git push origin $version

If CI is unavailable, the same release can be made by hand from what is in
dist/ right now:

  gh release create $version dist/* --draft \\
    --title "$version" --generate-notes

Either way SHA256SUMS has to be among the uploaded files: the install script
reads it from the release and refuses anything that does not match.
